1. Project Description:

This project is a translation game created to help people advance their foreign language skills, in particular Chinese and Korean sentence construction. There are several features: play, learn, customize, progress, and leaderboard. In addition, player data is saved so that they can continue their progress from previous sessions when they sign in.

- Play: The play mode allows for users to engage in an obstacle-style game where they aim to construct sentences correcting amidst enemy characters. 
- Learn: The learn mode uses a flashcard approach to help users learn translations of English sentences and their pronunciations. 
- Customize: The customize mode allows users to input sentences of their choice to practice in the play mode and make flashcards with in the learn mode.
- Progress: The progress mode shows a visual representation of the player's performance in the form of a bar graph, as well as statistics about their overall accuracy rate and individual verb accuracy rates.
- Leaderboard: The leaderboard shows the top ten users with the most total XP, or experience points, gained. Users can gain XP by correctly matching more translations and they will accumulate XP as they play more.
